Professional Portfolio
====
A project designed by Guillaume Simler. It was started in Feb 2016 and its aim is to give an overview of my professional project portfolio. This is especially important as my whole business career is unconventional: I work more on a project-basis than on classical jobs. I was not independant but worked mostly on the fridges of the corporations, taking care of their "bad boys" 

----
Page organization & files
----
The main page is not hard coded. The page setup is driven by javascript. 
* The main files are
  - profportfolio.html : the main page
  - profportfolioBuilder.js : the file containing the JSON and the related programs to build the website
  - profportfolioHelper.js : this file helps to format the JSON into HTML
  - profportfolio.css : the css file
  - temp.html: this file is the helper of the helper
* The additional API, libraries or frameworks are used:
  - Bootstrap (loaded via maxCDN): responsive grid system, design, dropdown menu 
  - picturefill (loaded by files): add <picture> elements for Safari (iOS, OS), help its responsiveness
  - jQUERY (loaded via google CDN): allow the use of this DOM modifying framework  

----
Future developments
----
Currently the file is generated by a JSON. In future a database might be more suitable
